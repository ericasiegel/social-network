## Description
This is the back end API to a Social Network. It uses a NoSQL database called MongoDB and Mongoose to regulate the databases. Starting the app by connecting to the server, a user can test all of the routes using Insamnia Core.

The Social Network API will give the users the opportunity to test out CRUD on the NoSQL database. They can test out GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests for users, the user's thoughts and reactions, and friends. The user can also see how many friends they have, or how many reactions their thoughts have.
